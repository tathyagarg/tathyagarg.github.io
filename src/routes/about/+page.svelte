<p class="pt-8">
  I'm Tathya, a 16-year old developer based in Bangalore, India. I've been
  coding for the past 5 years and have experience in web development, backend
  development, and low level programming.
  <br />
  <br />
  I'm currently more focused on low level programming and systems design - especially
  with Rust, C and Zig. I do, however, still enjoy web development and work on web-based
  projects from time-to-time. I primarily use
  <a class="intext" href="https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction">SvelteKit</a
  >
  for web development, but have experience with
  <a class="intext" href="https://react.dev/">ReactJS</a> as well.
